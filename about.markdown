Hi! I'm someone on the Internet. This blog is pretty spartan, I
know; I just needed a place to dump the stuff I write *somewhere*,
and GitHub Pages happened to be the least bullshit way to do it for free.

I enjoy Rust, NixOS (but only when it works), databending,
and doing cursed things to computers. I begrudgingly write Bash.

I don't really like maintaining wide-area online presences, but if
you want to contact me, poke me at the email address at the bottom.
