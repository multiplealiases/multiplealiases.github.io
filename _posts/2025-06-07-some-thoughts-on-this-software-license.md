Most of the articles on this blog are marked CC-BY-4.0 in the YAML front matter,
but I would like to make it known *visibly*, *here*,
that this article is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)<img src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/cc.svg" style="max-width: 1em;max-height:1em;margin-left: .2em;"><img src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/by.svg" style="max-width: 1em;max-height:1em;margin-left: .2em;">,

It'd be some irony to rail against copyright
and have this work be unmarked (thus All Rights Reserved), wouldn't it?
I'd put it in the public domain (or equivalent), but I like being cited.

So, this license. I think it sucks. I think it's wrong.
I will quote it in full, because I don't think it's worth putting
the project I got this from on blast, but it *is* worth
keeping around a full, unedited copy in case all other copies end up deleted.

The hell is this? Okay, let me break it down:

# It's cowardly

Before I talk into the wider problem,
let me say something about the moral position this license takes.
It specifically wants to shut out Bad People™,
but it's also downright cowardly.
I think a reality of living in a society is that,
eventually, what you do will end up ultimately,
indirectly contributing to evil.
It wouldn't take a prophet to say that NumPy is probably used
by militaries for calculations that will probably be used
to murder people.

I don't *like* this state of affairs, I really don't,
but don't you also go outside in daylight,
knowing that it increases your risk of cancer?
It's about risk *management*;
the Bad Thing may happen,
but isn't it worth it to have done the risky thing?
Don't you want to do some good?
Hell, it's not like NumPy is *made* to kill;
they've made a conveyor belt
which happens to be used by someone else to make guns.
You didn't set out to hurt people, so why act like you are?

Either you will have done some good and a tiny amount of bad,
or you will have done *no* good and *no* bad.
This license deprives others from doing good with your work,
because you're too scared of the comparatively tiny amount
of bad that could be done with it.
It's not a productive way to think about the problem.

I think if you really want to stop evil,
speak out against evil.
Donate time, money and other resources to causes against evil.
Do **something**, don't let this moral purity ritual paralyze you.

# FOSS licenses are a difficult compromise.

What I think I've understood about Free Software is that it's a legal shim.
All this is for is to use the copyright system against itself;
use a system that alienates fellow artists
(in the broadest sense)
from each other,
to bring us together.
It's so we can re-use each other's stuff without
fearing someone suing us down the line.

The thing is,
whenever we use tools of oppression like this,
we need to be intensely mindful of *what*
our system intends to achieve.
I don't think this license does what it intends to do.
I think it, instead, is the equivalent of posting
armed guards around your house in response to
a bulglary.
This license is actively telling people
(including your neighbors)
that you care more about "protection"
than about collaboration.

## Oh, and the FSF are clowns.

Don't tell me that the FSF does good work
when they tell everyone they should be using the GPL.
I don't want to hear it.
They're just going "uhm, acktually" at the problem here.
Again, free licensing is a legal shim.
If you do not remember this crucial detail,
you get dick-twisters like the one described in
[*the FSF’s relationship with firmware is harmful to free software users*](https://ariadne.space/2022/01/21/the-fsfs-relationship-with-firmware.html).

See, I'm still not too sure what causes are worthy,
but I do know something:
I don't think the FSF are promoting a worthy cause.
They've quite infamously allowed Richard M. Stallman
to stay, after all, and he's... [a troubling man](https://drewdevault.com/2023/11/25/2023-11-26-RMS-on-sex.html).
I dunno, like, we could balance this against
the notion of a culture that perhaps might be
zealots about performing
(but not necessarily doing) accountability,
but he's also had *decades* to walk it back.

Even ignoring the may-as-well-be leader of the movement's sex-pestilence,
I also don't think they're very interested in *any* sort of compromise
with their Free Software ideals.
I mean, look at how they think of firmware,
*a thing that you need to make your computer work*.
They don't want you to just try out some Free Software,
they don't want your stuff to be 99% Free or 1% Free,
these people want you to be exactly 100% Free and no less.

I'm sorry to say.
I think you sound like a pencil-necked, squeaky-voiced, "uhm, acktually"
nerd when you think like this.
I'm not perfect, I have been guilty of having such worms in my brain,
but you gotta do better than this.
Don't be a door-to-door Mormon.

# FOSS licenses are social contracts, too.

You ever see a promising codebase, but they
(likely some commercial entity,
but the Minecraft community has enough of these
that they're called "crayon licenses") put it under a "custom" license?
Have you ever been told
"nah, it's not worth it until you get a lawyer to review it"?
Well, what you've experienced is licensing-as-social-contract.

Licenses exist to cover our asses from others.
If you don't use a standard license,
we don't know on what terms the code can be used on,
because we'd have to hire a lawyer at tremendous expense.
While, yes, there are numerous quibbles related to the 'famous' licenses,
they're also less useful to express,
because it's 99% just a social game.
If someone sues and the MIT license ends up invalid,
thus reverting to All Rights Reserved,
*everyone's* done for.

Using this license is
building a moat
around your work...
especially around potential contributors.

# Don't we like remix culture?

I'm not a very good or talented or creative creative,
but isn't transformation generally a thing we like?
You get wonderful things like fanfic and game mods and entire genres of music.
*Since I Left You*,
a plunderphonics album that is entirely samples,
is a shell of its former self
in the international "we couldn't get all the samples cleared" release.

What are we *doing* here?
We've enforced a system where,
at the whim of copyright holders,
your work that is unrecognizable as any of its constituent samples,
can be gutted and cleaned out for infringing material.
It doesn't matter what the context is, and you better pay up, pirate.

What are *we* doing here?
We're fencing off our artistic work, our *world*, from each other.
We don't trust each other no more
because we think we're all out to jack each other's shit,
so we arm and defend ourselves with copyright.
Someone robs a store and, I guess,
we're all content with the idea that
the socially-responsible response
is to have bear traps and
tripwire-activated flamethrowers lying about.
We don't want them to merely stop what they're doing,
we want them to *suffer*.

Does this license think it only affects the named Bad People™?

# What *are* we doing here?

I feel when some people are given the Berne Convention-given
right to bludgeon others over the head with copyright, they do exactly that.
They're literally millionaires,
they have more money than most of us
will ever get to see--
but these chucklefucks will still feel like their work needs to be
"protected".

I *vehemently* disagree with this stance.
This is landlord shit.
Stop doing this.
Stop allowing it.
Stop selling artists on this.

More to the point,
I believe that these two things,
"copyright" and
"making a decent living"
are *orthogonal*.
They ain't related.
Do you think that plagiarists
*care* about the licensing of the work they
so gleefully steal and make extravagant livings off?
Hell no!
And what recourse, exactly,
is this prototypical starving artist *supposed* to have?
Copyright lawsuits cost tens of thousands,
if not hundreds of thousands,
to persue.

Only the rich and powerful get to enforce copyright protection.
Tell me with a straight face:
is this what's meant to "protect" us?
This violence against the social and creative fabric?

<div class="panel-info" markdown="1">
I'm told that publishers tend to be the ones pursuing suits.
I believe those people are unserious;
only going through the motions of what it means to "do business"
because "doing business" means they need to
"protect" their golden geese.
They'd sooner stick a knife in the creative fabric than
just let someone (very often someone much smaller than them)
be.

When Drug Dealer Simulator's *publisher*
(I must clarify, because some people think it was the devs)
[went after Schedule I for potential infringement](https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-smash-hit-schedule-1-getting-investigated-by-drug-dealer-simulator-publisher),
people rightfully went
"how money-hungry are you to go after an indie dev?".
They will forever now be tagged with that reputation.
People don't like you when you pursue copyright litigation.

How rich do you intend on being, traitor?
