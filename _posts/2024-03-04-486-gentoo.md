If you try to boot a Gentoo install CD in 86Box (or a real 486, lucky you!),
as of this writing, it won't get past GRUB.

GRUB's easy to get around, you just use the `syslinux` family of bootloaders instead, specifically `isolinux`.

That being said... something has changed since 2018.

# isolinux won't save you

Unpack a Gentoo x86 minimal install ISO into a directory (I use `bsdtar`), cd
into the directory, fetch a copy of
[`isolinux.bin`](https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/9/BaseOS/x86_64/os/isolinux/isolinux.bin) and
[`ldlinux.c32`](https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/9/BaseOS/x86_64/os/isolinux/ldlinux.c32),
save this file as `isolinux.cfg`:

```txt
DEFAULT gentoo
LABEL gentoo
	KERNEL /boot/gentoo
	INITRD /boot/gentoo.igz
	APPEND cdroot nomodeset console=tty1
```

run this command:

```console
$ mkisofs -o gentoo-i486-syslinux-only.iso -b isolinux.bin -c boot.catalog -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -J -R .
```

Load that ISO into 86Box, though there's a slight hitch here.
486 motherboards made when the 486 was new[^1] predate El Torito, so they won't boot off CD.
I suggest using a SCSI card and enabling its BIOS to get around that.
Once that's done, you'll be greeted with failure:

and as you wait for a kernel that never boots, you'll come
to the realization that you've entered `endbr32` hell.

## Prior Art

Before I get too ahead of myself, I'm going to say right now
that I'm standing on someone else's shoulders. Wait, no, that's not what I --

I'm not the first person to do this. Yeo Kheng Meng in his article
[A Science Project: "Make the 486 Great Again!" - Modern Linux in an ancient PC](https://yeokhengmeng.com/2018/01/make-the-486-great-again/)
did the same thing back in 2018. And that was on real hardware! I'm limited to an emulator
that I'm assuming is accurate enough for my purposes.

# `endbr32`, and why I hate it

`endbr32` comes from Intel's (brace yourself)
"Control-flow Enforcement Technology". I'm sure Intel CET does very important things,
but for the purposes of this cursed adventure, it's i486 Enemy #1.
`endbr32` decodes to [a hinting NOP on Pentium Pros and later (give or take)](https://www.jookia.org/wiki/Nopl),
but is an illegal instruction on 486s and Pentiums ("586", as some might call them).

This causes significant problems for a 486 running binaries "polluted" with
CET instructions. The rot goes further! If GCC itself wasn't built with
`--disable-cet`, it'll end up into GCC's builtins, which propagates further
into the libc, which propagates into the userland, which causes 486s to "die in pain".[^2]

For that reason, I'm gonna be using [__a patch__](assets/486-gentoo/0001-WIP-patch-kernel-to-skip-endbr32-instruction-on-real.patch)
that lets 486s "jump over" `endbr32`. I've modified the paths in my copy to make it work
as a `-p1` patch, but it's otherwise unmodified from [the one in the gray486linux repo](https://github.com/marmolak/gray486linux/blob/33e67c720616180b9d3a22ffc4125a9a52018838/releases/hanggai/src/patches/kernel/0001-WIP-patch-kernel-to-skip-endbr32-instruction-on-real.patch).

The patch isn't joking, by the way. The table goes something like this:

| `--disable-cet`/patched | Yes    | No            |
|-------------------------|--------|---------------|
| Yes                     | Works! | Works!        |
| No                      | Works! | Dies in pain. |

I don't quite get it, but the patch magically fixes kernels built with CET-enabled compilers.
Plus, it grants your machine a 'get out of crash free' card; even if the kernel is
CET-free and the userland is CET-free, the things you're compiling
are likely going to try checking for CET support. I haven't checked if it does crash
a 486, but I wouldn't risk crashing the system while configuring binutils.

# It's Gentooin' Time

So! Let's go and patch the kernel, specifically 6.6.19 LTS.

```console
$ curl -O https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/linux-6.6.19.tar.xz
$ tar xf linux-6.6.19.tar.xz
$ cd linux-6.6.19
$ patch -p1 < 0001-WIP-patch-kernel-to-skip-endbr32-instruction-on-real.patch
```

I had to `make tinyconfig` and start configuring from there, but [you get to use the config I wrote](assets/486-gentoo/486-kconfig).
For whatever reason, it seems like enabling some things crashes the machine regardless of CETitude.
I didn't feel like tracking it down, and it's probably best to start with a bare-minimum kernel
that just barely boots [my specific 86Box config](assets/486-gentoo/86box.cfg)[^3]

Oh, make sure to move my `.config` into place.

```console
$ cp ../486-kconfig .config
```

As usual, `make -j$(nproc)` (or however many cores you have if you don't have `nproc`).

Download the latest x86 Gentoo minimal install ISO.
We're gonna need to unpack the Gentoo ISO and transplant syslinux and our kernel...

```console
$ mkdir unpack && cd unpack
$ bsdtar xf install-x86-minimal-*.iso # or however you extract ISOs

## Bit weird to link to Rocky Linux, but this seems to be the
## only reliable place to find isolinux.bin and ldlinux.c32 as loose files

$ curl --remote-name-all https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/9/BaseOS/x86_64/os/isolinux/isolinux.bin https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/9/BaseOS/x86_64/os/isolinux/ldlinux.c32
$ cp ../linux-6.6.19/arch/x86/boot/bzImage boot/gentoo
```

...splat in an `isolinux.cfg`...

```console
cat > isolinux.cfg << \EOF
DEFAULT gentoo
LABEL gentoo
    KERNEL /boot/gentoo
    INITRD /boot/gentoo.igz
    APPEND cdroot nomodeset
EOF
```

...and generate the ISO.

```console
$ mkisofs -o gentoo-i486.iso -b isolinux.bin -c boot.catalog -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -J -R .
```

Load that sucker into 86Box and watch it go! Very slowly. Excruciatingly slowly.
25 megahertz isn't very fast, after all. I suggest switching to a faster 486-class chip;
the Intel iDX4 at 100 MHz is your best bet[^4]. You might need to wait hours (3 hours on the 486DX/25)
to see it boot, but it'll work. "Pics or it didn't happen", so here's it downloading binutils:

![86Box emulating a 486 downloading binutils](assets/486-gentoo/486-gentoo-binutils.png)

Isn't it great? Taste that 5 kilobyte-a-second download speed! There's plenty of candidates for
"slowest machine to run Linux", but I'm reasonably sure this counts as the slowest machine
to run a Linux distro with minor modifications to the install media. Not just a kernel,
not a kernel and a static BusyBox glued to the end, a general-purpose Linux distribution.

# Making it boot faster

Okay, it works. But it takes forever to boot -- 3 hours is excruciating, and I'd posit
you'd like that not to be the case. The xz compression used in the initramfs and
squashfs is really dragging down (up?) boot time here.
We can instead recompress these files into lz4. lz4 has a pretty poor compression
ratio, but it decompresses *fast*. It's fast enough that it tends to do as
well as, or better than[^5], a straight RAM-to-RAM copy on modern machines.

Alright, let's get down to business.

```console
$ mkdir unpack-lz4 && cd unpack-lz4
$ bsdtar xf install-x86-minimal-*.iso
$ curl --remote-name-all https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/9/BaseOS/x86_64/os/isolinux/isolinux.bin https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/9/BaseOS/x86_64/os/isolinux/ldlinux.c32
$ cp ../linux-6.6.19/arch/x86/boot/bzImage boot/gentoo
# unsquashfs -d ../squashfs image.squashfs && sync
# mksquashfs ../squashfs image.squashfs -comp lz4 -Xhc -noappend && sync
# xzcat boot/gentoo.igz | lz4 -lc -12 --favor-decSpeed > gentoo.igz.tmp
# mv gentoo.igz.tmp boot/gentoo.igz
$ mkisofs -o gentoo-i486-lz4.iso -b isolinux.bin -c boot.catalog -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -J -R .
```

I can't exactly show you in text that this makes it boot faster, but try it!
My testing says it should only take 40 minutes on a 486DX/25 instead of 3 hours.

I mean, that's still "forever" by most standards, but it's booting 3 times faster.
You can probably optimize this better by deleting useless stuff in the squashfs;
kernel modules are an obvious target, since you're booting a kernel that doesn't
have modules built for it, nor loadable kernel module support in the first place.

# Great, what now?

I don't know.

I've tested it a decent bit, and it looks pretty stable to me.

I've tried to install Gentoo on a 486 *without* using the Gentoo binhost, though I
had to abort my first run because of recording problems.[^6]

I plan on performing LFS after completing the Gentoo run, just for the extra pain.
1 SBU on a 486DX at 25 MHz goes into the tens of hours, mind. It's gonna take forever.
I'm gonna have to figure out how to distribute the entire stream as a single recording;
YouTube only allows VODs of streams up to 12 hours long, and I'll likely need to go into
the thousands to complete this intensely pointless quest.

If *you*, dear reader, do anything interesting with this knowledge... bonk me at
my email. I don't maintain a 'wide-area' online presence.

# Things I couldn't stuff into parentheses

[^1]: Yes, there are still 486-class CPUs (well, systems-on-chip) being made
      today for embedded reasons. The "Vortex86" line is a real hoot;
      there's a 1 GHz 486DX in that lineup!

[^2]: Explanation and phrasing yoinked from [marmolak/gray486linux](https://github.com/marmolak/gray486linux/blob/33e67c720616180b9d3a22ffc4125a9a52018838/releases/hanggai/src/patches/kernel/0001-WIP-patch-kernel-to-skip-endbr32-instruction-on-real.patch).

[^3]: I've had this set to use PCap networking instead of SLiRP; I've had 86Box
      crash trying to download anything using SLiRP.

      It will also initialize a 20 GB `.vhd` dynamic-size disk image. It
      won't literally take up 20 GB straight away, but I figured you should take note.

[^4]: I can't tell if the Cyrix Cx5x86 is or isn't an "i586" in terms of instruction set,
      and I'm not taking my chances with the AMD 586s or the "(enhanced)" 486s, either.

[^5]: The "or better" part is why the PlayStation 5 has a dedicated decompression unit;
      fast-decompressing formats like this let you 'cheat' extra bandwidth out of the
      same storage medium, so long as your decompression thingamabob can keep up.

[^6]: Yes, I *am* thinking of recording (and streaming) my next run.
      I even have the stream overlay to show for it!
