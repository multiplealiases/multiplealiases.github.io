Sometimes I write hacks.
Here's a place for them, along with commentary.

# Why?

I feel like I write a lot of useful but difficult-to-place snippets,
and I don't feel very good about padding out my blog with single snippets.
It just doesn't feel right to me.
I know some people make "experimental" repos,
but it feels, in some way,
Too Formal to put it in Git,
rather than just dumping them to my blog.

# Real working Quadlets I use in production

There are so few in-the-wild Quadlets out there on the Web,
and what few are available are poorly-documented.
Let me provide two worked examples.

## bgutil Proof-of-Origin Token server (for yt-dlp reasons)

Full details are at [yt-dlp's wiki](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/PO-Token-Guide),
but the short of it is that YouTube now sometimes wants PO tokens
to make your traffic look less bot-like.

<pre-header tag="file">/etc/containers/systemd/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider.container</pre-header>
```ini
[Unit]
Description=yt-dlp POT provider

[Container]
# Fully-qualified to allow AutoUpdate=registry to work.
Image=docker.io/brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider
AutoUpdate=registry

RunInit=true
# This might not be common knowledge;
# podman-run(1) has the details,
# but you can restrict the IP the container binds to.
# This one means
# "bind only to localhost on port 4416 inside and outside the container".
PublishPort=127.0.0.1:4416:4416

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

## Raspberry Flavoured Minecraft server

While this one is for Raspberry Flavoured,
I expect it to be generalizable.
Refer to [the docs](https://docker-minecraft-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/variables/)
for more env vars.

<pre-header tag="file">/etc/containers/systemd/raspberry-flavoured.container</pre-header>

# otherwise it'll default to vanilla, latest.

Environment=FORGE_VERSION=43.4.12

# CurseForge requires you to have an API key,
# which is annoying.
# I believe PackWiz and Modrinith are easiest to work with.
# See https://docker-minecraft-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mods-and-plugins/
# for details.

# ...but I can reasonably vouch for lz4.
# zlib (the default) is obsolete.

# in other, more currently relevant aspects,
# such as compression ratio and compression/decompression speed.
Environment=REGION_FILE_COMPRESSION=lz4

# Change this if you want, my setup is exposed over public IPv6,
# so the application itself needs to be secured in some way.
# An auth mod would do you fine here, but this one's built-in.
# Make sure to write an ops.json and whitelist.json,
# or you'll be locked out of your own server!
Environment=ENABLE_WHITELIST=true

# You'll need this to actually make the server accessible.
# Change these if you run on a different port.
PublishPort=25565:25565

# This is more-or-less arbitrary, right, but
# it's preferable to keep it consistent.

# I didn't do my testing with an SELinux-enabled system.

### One possible backup service

<div class="panel-danger" markdown="1">
#### I don't suggest you do this.

I don't know whether this correctly syncs the state of the server
before it does a backup.
I've placed a `sleep 30` in there to be reasonably sure,
but any kind of fixed delay for disk sync is sketchy business.

This is a lesser problem,
but I've been told systemd maintainers would be very displeased with my work.
Ah, well, is it good art if it doesn't make people feel?
</div>

<pre-header tag="file">/etc/systemd/system/backup-raspberry.service</pre-header>
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Back up Raspberry Flavoured MC server

# Conflicts= is used here so that raspberry-flavoured.service
# is brought down when this service starts back up.
Conflicts=raspberry-flavoured.service

[Service]
# chdir here so that the tar command there
# produces an archive with paths starting in
#   raspberry/
# instead of
#   /srv/minecraft/raspberry/
# I know you can do -C on... most tar impls, but this came to mind first.
WorkingDirectory=/srv/minecraft

# Extremely sketchy fixed delay to let the Minecraft server wind down.
# Strongly consider replacing.
ExecStartPre=sleep 30
ExecStartPre=sync

# ! choice of compressor !
#
# It kinda doesn't matter, given that most of
# a data folder's size is incompressible,
# but I think it's worth giving it a light tap;
# 75% of original size isn't *much* but it's *something*.
# I like zstd here because it produces decent ratios while
# also being reasonably fast to decompress.
#
# ! date !
#
# That date format is just date -Iminutes with the
# timezone replaced with the letter "Z" to mean UTC.
# This is ISO 8601 compliant, but GNU date prints "+00:00" instead.
#
# ! templating thoughts !
# I suspect it's possible to template this with a bit more finagling.
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash -c 'tar -I "zstd -3 -T0" -cf /var/minecraft-backups/raspberry-"$(date --utc +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ)".tar.zst raspberry; sync'

# I'd like the server to be brought back up once the backup is done.
# This is sketchy, but it does work.
# I'd like to see a future Interrupts= key that encodes both
# "stop this service" and "start it back up on exit".
ExecStopPost=systemctl start raspberry-flavoured.service
```

I don't use a timer service because I'm the only player on my server,
so I trigger backups manually.
A timer service should be trivial to get up and running.

# Stop a headless laptop-server from sleeping with the lid closed (systemd)

There are some *weird* answers to this problem floating around.

* Masking the sleep, suspend, hibernate, and hybrid-sleep services entirely.
  (makes logind hog a whole CPU core and produce huge amounts of log spam)

* Disabling ACPI entirely in kernel cmdline by passing `acpi=off`.
  (ACPI does other things too!!)

* *Unbinding* the lid switch entirely via sysfs.
  (Huh?!)

So, here, the *correct* solution.

<pre-header tag="snippet">/etc/systemd/logind.conf</pre-header>
```ini
[login]
# (...)
HandleLidSwitch=ignore
HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=ignore
HandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore
```

# Getting DuckDNS to do *only* IPv6

I didn't want to set up port-forwarding,
and UPnP on my router is flaky.

First, clear any existing records.
You don't want a useless A (IPv4) record to confuse your users.

<pre-header tag="file">/usr/local/bin/duckdns-clear.sh</pre-header>
```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
token=FILL_THIS_IN
domain=FILL_THIS_IN
echo url="https://www.duckdns.org/update?domains=${domain}&token=${token}&clear=true" | curl -K -
```

Then, we need two parts. First is the script that does a single update.
This part is general to any init system.

<pre-header tag="file">/usr/local/bin/duckdns-update-v6.sh</pre-header>
```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
# Any number of these v6 IP detection websites is fine.
# I could probably hack together an ip invocation, but I couldn't be assed.
ipv6addr=$(curl -6 https://ifconfig.co)
token=FILL_THIS_IN
domain=FILL_THIS_IN
echo url="https://www.duckdns.org/update?domains=${domain}&token=${token}&ipv6=${ipv6addr}" | curl -K -
```

And then the systemd service and timer units.

<pre-header tag="file">/etc/systemd/system/duckdns.service</pre-header>
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Update DuckDNS (v6 only)

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/duckdns-update-v6.sh
```

<pre-header tag="file">/etc/systemd/system/duckdns.timer</pre-header>
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Update DuckDNS entries periodically
After=network-online.service

[Timer]
OnBootSec=15s

# Adjust this to taste.
# My v6 addresses expire every 5 minutes,
# so I set the refresh interval to 4 minutes.
OnUnitActiveSec=240s
AccuracySec=15s

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

As usual, `systemctl daemon-reload` after installing these files.

# A Gentoo env file that got 32-bit x86 FFmpeg building with glibc/Clang/ThinLTO

For reference, this was done on a 64-bit x86_64 Gentoo system that typically
uses glibc and GCC.
I just wanted FFmpeg built with LTO for funsies, but I also
enabled `ABI_X86="64 32"` system-wide for ease of admin.
This meant that I had to build x86 FFmpeg as well.

Credit goes to [GitHub project InBetweenNames/gentooLTO issue #354, Build ffmpeg with -ffat-lto-objects](https://github.com/InBetweenNames/gentooLTO/issues/354)
for `-ffat-lto-objects`.
I should probably take this up with upstream,
but I'm not sure how to approach the question.

The rest of this is ripped from the
[Gentoo Wiki article for LTO](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/LTO#Rust_on_GCC_systems).

# Manual full â†’ tv levels mapping (in case FFmpeg doesn't like you)

yuvj420p (and other "j" pixel formats) are full-level pixel formats.
Normally FFmpeg can convert them just fine,
but in the case of `yuvj420p` â†’ `yuv420p10le` conversion
(as you might do for AV1 encoding),
it simply makes no attempt to do level conversions;
it assumes that the video is already using `tv` levels.

Here's a filtergraph statement that'll simply force the matter,
though I'd imagine there's probably some precision loss or something.

<pre-header tag="filtergraph"></pre-header>
```
# to convert [16, 235] to [0, 255]:
# subtract by 16 to get [0, 219]
# multiply by 255/219 to get [0, 255]
# clip values between [0, 255] for good measure.
geq=lum='clip((p(X, Y) - 16) * 1.164383562, 0, 255)':cb='clip((p(X, Y) - 16) * 1.164383562, 0, 255)':cr='clip((p(X, Y) - 16) * 1.164383562, 0, 255)'
```

You may also want to detect the pixel format before doing this,
as it clearly wouldn't make sense for `tv`-level content to
be subjected to this.

```sh
pix_fmt="$(ffprobe -v error -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 -show_entries 'stream=pix_fmt' -select_streams V:0 "${input}")"
```
