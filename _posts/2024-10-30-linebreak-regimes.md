```
So I have 40 columns to write each line in, and oops that was too long

So I have 5 words to
write each line in.
That should be enough, right?
It should be a reasonable
estimation of 40 cols, assuming
I got my guesswork
right.

It seems pretty ugly, to
be frank, but I'll work
with this. Let's go
rant about YouTube auto-captions: they
switched to making them look
like ahead-of-time captions:

So you end up with
shit that looks like this,
not split on any coherent
boundaries. It makes the train
of thought being spoken look
downright *frenzied*. Who speaks like
this?

Wait, what am I doing?
Do I not sound frenzied?

So I have 40 columns to write in.
I don't know where that went, I'm just
breaking on every exceeding-40 col word
and hoping for the best. This doesn't
feel good, though. It's not
semantically right, as blocky of a
block as this is.

I would have pulled out fmt(1) for this
experiment, but I figured it was too
much effort for the joke, and besides,
I don't want to run fmt(1) passes all
over my work the whole time!

So I have a semantic unit to write each line in.
This is an approximation of what's known as a Semantic Line Break.
Notice: a thought, a line.

I just plowed through
the previous column limits,
but whatever,
it'd look like this if I tried.
And now for an entry:

I'm temporarily living with
two beautiful cats.
One tabby, the other white
(though with an orange tint).
The white cat is avoidant,
though she's fairly responsive to pets
if she wishes to be interacted with.
The other just loves my attention,
though --
opening my door is a process in which
I must prevent him from
trying to enter my room.
He's a big baby of a man;
at once physically large,
but embodying smallness.
